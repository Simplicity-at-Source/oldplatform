# Stateless Expressor

This expressor manages 'stateless' services. These are services that hold no state of their own, and so multiple
instances of the service can exist in parallel. 

### Dev Quickstart

If it is not already installed, request the cell expressor to boot a stateless expressor
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"stateless-expressor", "image":"sp_platform/spi_stateless_expressor"}' http://172.17.0.3:8080/cell
```

After a few seconds, you will see a new container running `cell-stateless-expressor`

Then, request the stateless expressor to create a service.
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"my-service", "image":"tfduesing/apache", "count":2}' http://172.17.0.3:8080/stateless

```

You will then see 2 new containers running that implement these services.

Update the gene to change the requested instances

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"my-service", "image":"tfduesing/apache", "count":10}' http://172.17.0.3:8080/stateless
```

### Statess Expressor

The expressor is the controlling service allowing users to request stateless services be run with particular runtime characteristics.

In common with the other expressors, it is declarative in nature, and reacts to specific 'genes' being
uploaded into the gene store at the /stateless url.

*Stateless Schema*
```
{
  "id": "my ID"         //the name of the cluster, must be unique across the platform
  "image": "some image" //the docker image that will be run.
  "count": 3            // the number of instances that SP should maintain.
  "env": {
     "myenv":"envvalue",
     "myotherenv":"envvalue"
  }
}
```

Via Curl, inserting into to the local gene store, this would be
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"my-service", "image":"tfduesing/apache", "count":10}' http://172.17.0.3:8080/stateless
```

Container(s) will then be fired up and configured to satisfy this request.  
Currently, only count and env are valid runtime params, more will be added in future releases..
