# OLD Core

PaaS for Micro-Services

## Local Installation

OLD Core adds PaaS capabilities on top of the core Docker infrastructure and container management functionality.

It does not seek to replace or abstract Docker.

To start OLD, install Docker and the unix utility, socat.

Build the OLD images into your local image repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/Simplicity-at-Source/oldplatform
cd oldplatform
./build.sh
./cli/dev-init
```

Running `build.sh` will download and install all the OLD core docker images.

Runing `cli/dev-init` will install the minimal set of services to act as a PaaS on a single node.

These components allow you to take existing Docker images, as normal, and securely deploy them to 
the local Docker with declarative Service Injection, via the API.


## Deploy a service locally

make sure you've got this entry in your muon hosts file:
``` 
127.0.0.1 	simplenode.OLD.cistechfutures.net 
```

Now run the script to deploy a simple nodejs web service:
```
cd ./test-scripts
./create-simplenode-stateless.sh
```


Now, go to the address below in your browser: 
```
http://simplenode.OLD.cistechfutures.net/
```
