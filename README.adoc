Simple PaaS for Micro-Services Implementation 

## Local Installation

SimplePaaS adds PaaS capabilities on top of the core Docker infrastructure and container management functionality.

It does not seek to replace or abstract Docker.

To start using SimplePaaS, install Docker and the unix utility, socat.

Build the SimplePaaS images into your local image repo.

```
build.sh
```

The SimplePaaS command line tool, `sp` is available for interacting with a SimplePaaS installation.
To install the platform, run `sp devinit`, this will install the minimal set of services to act as a PaaS on a single node.

These components allow you to take existing Docker images, as normal, and securely deploy them to 
the local Docker with declarative Service Injection, via the API.

## Component Structure

### Service

Each component consists of a Service implementation.  This will be some runnable artifact that will 
implement some functionality running in the container.

Each folder should contain a build.sh script that will execute whatever build steps are necessary.
Build tools should be bootstrapped by this script and not assumed to be installed. (eg, using gradlew)

### Container 

Each Micro Service will be bundled into a container for deployment into SimplPaaS.  This process of bundling is 
managed via a Dockerfile.

Each container folder must contain a Dockerfile

The Dockerfile should contain the normal information to build the container, plus some meta data to indicate
the required/ provided service dependencies

A simple Redis service
```
FROM        ubuntu:12.10
MAINTAINER Simplicity Itself
RUN         apt-get update
RUN         apt-get -y install redis-server
EXPOSE      6379
ENV PROVIDES redis:6379
ENTRYPOINT  ["/usr/bin/redis-server"]
```

This service indicates to the managing SimplePaaS components that it *provides* the redis capability, running on port 6379.
This information will be used by platform to permit declarative service wiring and checking of runtime links between containers
