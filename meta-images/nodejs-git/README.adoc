# NODEJS-GIT

this container will checkout any public nodejs git project and run it in a docker container

depends on nodejs-image existing

compatible nodejs projects on github must have app.js in root folder to work



### Example

```
 ./run_any.sh simplenode https://github.com/fuzzy-logic/simplenode.git 8888 4444
```

then test with curl -X GET http://localhost:4444



### Notes
Currently using the -link approach, which seems a little crap from what I've read, but it is at least working.
